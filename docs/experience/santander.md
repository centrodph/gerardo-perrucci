    - Improving developers skills.
    - Code review / Code quality.
    - Implementing security rules.
    - Evolutionary development.

During my first year as technical leader I was leading a team of 8 developers. My obligation was to improve my teamâ€™s abilities and assume the responsibility of timelines with the client.

By the end of the first year the team had grown and we finished the year with more than 20 developers and 2 team leaders (Backend, Frontend).
