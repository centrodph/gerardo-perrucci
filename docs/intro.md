# About me

## Cover letter

With over 12 years of experience as a full stack developer, I bring a wealth of expertise in a diverse range of technologies to the table. For the past 8 years, I have served as a technical leader, actively involved in both team management and project oversight.

In addition to my technical responsibilities, I have played a pivotal role in managing teams, handling estimations, and facilitating communication across cross-functional teams to ensure seamless project delivery.

My skill set encompasses leadership, problem-solving, research, analytical innovation, and proficiency in various software engineering techniques and design patterns. I pride myself on being a responsible, creative, honest, proactive team member who thrives in collaborative environments.

Throughout my career journey, I have honed my craft in front-end development using Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Transitioning to server-side applications, I expanded my repertoire after pursuing careers in PHP and Java within Education IT. My proficiency extends to frameworks such as CodeIgniter, Symfony, and Spring/Spring Boot. Additionally, I possess strong competencies in SQL relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQLServer.

In recent years, while continuing to excel in front-end development with leading frameworks like React and Angular, I've also delved deeper into back-end technologies, particularly Java. Additionally, I've embarked on a journey exploring Python and data visualization, broadening my skill set to encompass a wider spectrum of technologies and applications. Whether it's crafting intuitive user interfaces or designing robust back-end systems, I approach each project with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.
