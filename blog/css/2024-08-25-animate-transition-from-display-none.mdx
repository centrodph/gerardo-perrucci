Animating elements from `display: none` to `display: block` has long been a challenge in CSS. The traditional `display` property doesn't support transitions, making smooth animations difficult. However, with the introduction of the `@starting-style` at-rule and other new CSS features, we now have powerful tools to create seamless transitions between these states.

## The Challenge with display: none

Traditionally, animating an element from `display: none` to `display: block` wasn't possible because:

1. The `display` property is not animatable.
2. When an element is `display: none`, it's removed from the document flow, making it impossible to transition its properties.

## New CSS Features for Smooth Animations

Chrome 116 and 117 introduced four new web platform features that enable smooth animations and transitions for discrete properties:

1. Animating `display` and `content-visibility` on a keyframe timeline (Chrome 116+)
2. The `transition-behavior` property with the `allow-discrete` keyword (Chrome 117+)
3. The `@starting-style` rule for entry animations (Chrome 117+)
4. The `overlay` property to control top-layer behavior during animations (Chrome 117+)

Let's explore these features in detail.

## Animating display in Keyframes

From Chrome 116, you can use `display` and `content-visibility` in keyframe rules. Here's an example:

```css
.card {
  animation: fade-out 0.5s forwards;
}

@keyframes fade-out {
  100% {
    opacity: 0;
    display: none;
  }
}
```

This animation fades out the element and sets it to `display: none` at the end.

## The transition-behavior Property

To transition discrete properties like `display`, use the `allow-discrete` mode of the `transition-behavior` property:

```css
.card {
  transition: opacity 0.25s, display 0.25s;
  transition-behavior: allow-discrete;
}

.card.fade-out {
  opacity: 0;
  display: none;
}
```

## The @starting-style Rule for Entry Animations

The `@starting-style` rule allows you to define the initial state for entry animations:

```css
@starting-style {
  .item {
    opacity: 0;
    height: 0;
  }
}

.item {
  height: 3rem;
  display: grid;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: opacity 0.5s, transform 0.5s, height 0.5s, display 0.5s allow-discrete;
}
```

This setup creates a smooth entry animation from `height: 0` and `opacity: 0` to the final state.

## Animating Elements to and from the Top Layer

For elements like dialogs and popovers that use the top layer, you can use `@starting-style` and the `overlay` property for smooth animations:

```css
@starting-style {
  dialog[open] {
    translate: 0 100vh;
  }
}

dialog[open] {
  translate: 0 0;
}

dialog {
  transition: translate 0.7s ease-out, overlay 0.7s ease-out allow-discrete, display 0.7s ease-out allow-discrete;
  translate: 0 100vh;
}
```

The `overlay` property ensures that the element stays in the top layer during the animation, preventing it from being clipped or covered by other elements.

## CodePen Example

Here's a CodePen demonstrating these techniques:

## Browser Support

As of 2024, these features are supported in most modern browsers, including Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. However, it's always a good idea to check [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/?search=starting-style) for the latest browser support information.

## Fallback for Older Browsers

For browsers that don't support these new features, you can use a JavaScript-based fallback:

```javascript
if (!CSS.supports('@starting-style {}')) {
  // Fallback animation logic here
}
```

## Conclusion

The introduction of `@starting-style`, `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`, and the `overlay` property provides elegant solutions to the long-standing problem of animating elements from `display: none` to `display: block`. These features allow for smooth, performant transitions without the need for complex JavaScript workarounds.
