            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you're a teacher and your students are working on a group project. One student is a math whiz, another excels at writing, and a third is a history buff. If you grade each section based on the individual's absolute strengths, the math whiz would dominate the score, even if the writing and history were excellent. This is similar to what can happen in machine learning with features (data points) on vastly different scales.</p>
<p><strong>Feature scaling</strong> is a data pre-processing technique that addresses this issue. It essentially standardizes the range of features in your dataset, ensuring all features contribute equally during model training. Let's delve deeper into why and how this works.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-scale">Why Scale?<a href="https://centrodph.github.io/gerardo-perrucci/blog/machine-learning/machine-learning-process#why-scale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Scale?" title="Direct link to Why Scale?">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fair Play for All Features:</strong> Features with larger values can overshadow those with smaller ones, even if the smaller ones hold valuable information. Scaling creates a level playing field.</li>
<li><strong>Distance Matters:</strong> Many machine learning algorithms rely on calculating distances between data points. Feature scaling ensures these distances accurately reflect the underlying relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Faster &amp; More Efficient Learning:</strong> By putting features on a similar scale, the learning algorithm can converge (find an optimal solution) faster and more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="normalization-vs-standardization-two-sides-of-the-scaling-coin">Normalization vs. Standardization: Two Sides of the Scaling Coin<a href="https://centrodph.github.io/gerardo-perrucci/blog/machine-learning/machine-learning-process#normalization-vs-standardization-two-sides-of-the-scaling-coin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Normalization vs. Standardization: Two Sides of the Scaling Coin" title="Direct link to Normalization vs. Standardization: Two Sides of the Scaling Coin">​</a></h3>
<p>Normalization and standardization are two common feature scaling techniques, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, there's a subtle difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Normalization:</strong> This technique scales features to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1 (Min-Max Scaling) or -1 and 1. It's useful when you know the data distribution or want to bound values within a specific range.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standardization:</strong> This technique transforms features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (Z-score normalization). It assumes a Gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution for the data and emphasizes outliers more than normalization.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choosing the Right Technique:</strong></p>
<p>The best technique depends on your data and the specific algorithm you're using. Here's a general guideline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Min-Max scaling if the data distribution is unknown or outliers are not a concern.</li>
<li>Use standardization (Z-score) if the data is assumed to be Gaussian distributed or you want to emphasize the impact of outliers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a dataset with two features: house price (in millions) and distance from a school (in meters). Without scaling, the massive price range would overpower the distance information. Scaling levels the field, allowing the model to learn from both features effectively.</p>

<p>Remember, feature scaling is a crucial step in building robust and accurate machine learning models. By ensuring all features are on the same page, you can empower your models to learn from your data more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing the Right Technique:</strong></p>
<p>The best technique depends on your data and the specific algorithm you're using. Here's a general guideline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>normalization</code> scaling if the data distribution is unknown or outliers are not a concern.</li>
<li>Use <code>standardization</code> (Z-score) if the data is assumed to be Gaussian distributed or you want to emphasize the impact of outliers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this addition clarifies the concepts of normalization and standardization with their respective formulas!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The new React compiler introduced in React 19 it will significantly improve React development.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The new React compiler introduced in React 19 it will significantly improve React development.</strong></p>
<p>React's new compiler is an innovative tool designed to automatically optimize your React applications. By deeply understanding your code, the compiler applies optimizations grounded in React’s core principles. These optimizations can lead to significant performance enhancements, especially for complex applications.</p>
<p>Currently in its experimental phase, the new compiler has the potential to revolutionize React development. It's particularly interesting to see how it will interact with the <code>inline</code> optimization technique used in React like memo, useMemo useCallback.</p>
<p>The ongoing development and integration of the compiler promise exciting advancements in the efficiency and performance of React applications. As the tool matures, it could become a game-changer for developers seeking to build faster, more efficient applications.</p>
<p>Some bullet points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new experimental tool called the React compiler can automatically optimize your React application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It accomplishes this by thoroughly comprehending the code and applying optimizations based on React's principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can result in performance improvements, particularly for intricate applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compiler is still in its experimental phase, but it has the potential to revolutionize React development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be interesting to see how it affects the <code>inline</code> optimization technique used in React like memo, useMemo useCallback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, according to the document (<a href="https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler</a>), the React compiler can optimize your React application in a few specific cases.</p>
<p><strong>It can automatically memoize certain values or groups of values within your components and hooks.</strong> This means it can cache the results of functions so that they don't have to be recalculated every time the component renders if the inputs haven't changed.</p>
<p>In addition, the compiler can skip over re-rendering components that haven't changed. For instance, if a parent component re-renders, it won't necessarily force all of its child components to re-render as well. Finally, is important to note that the code is expected to follow the <strong>React Rules</strong> in order to work properly with the compiler. Learn more about the React Rules: <a href="https://react.dev/reference/rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://react.dev/reference/rules</a></p>
